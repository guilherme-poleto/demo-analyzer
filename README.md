# CS2 Demo Analyzer
This project leverages [boiler-writter](https://github.com/akiver/boiler-writter) to fetch the most recent CS2 matches from the Steam GC, and uses the [CS2 demo parser](https://github.com/LaihoE/demoparser) created by [@LaihoE](https://github.com/LaihoE) to parse all the data from the demo files.

## Why?
The current objective is to analyze gameplay aspects like accuracy and precision. As part of my Undergraduate thesis, I plan to incorporate AI to identify suspicious behaviors and potentially detect cheaters.
